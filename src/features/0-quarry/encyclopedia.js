        Block spawn calculations work a bit differently.<br>
        They are weighted and their weight increases up to "chance max" and then decreases
        until it no longer spawns.
        This scales linearly.

        <br><br>
        Where am I? How'd I get here? What am I doing here?<br>
        Oh look, there's a village nearby.<br>
        I'm just going to look around that settlement.

        <br><br>
        Hmmm... A worker? Maybe I can talk for a moment...<br>
        I question about this settlement. The worker says, "This is a quarry site, we mine for the motherland."<br>
        I remember about how hard this was years ago. It was unbearable.<br>
        But I come to a realization.

        <br><br>
        He was neither a brave worker, nor a slave.<br>
        He needs mana in order to free himself with helpers.<br>
        A-ha! Mana is what I need to live on, he said.<br>
        And so, the journey begins.

        <br><br>
        Welcome to the Longest Incremental<sup>2</sup>. Here, you can hire Miners with Mana.<br>
        Later on, you can sell ores for Green Papers which can be spent for Upgrades!<br>
        Have fun <s>and don't forget about the void</s>!
