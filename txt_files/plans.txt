Miners, Quarry, Selling, Treasures, and Green Papers are done.

------------------------------------ *** LAYER 0 - START *** ------------------------------------
This is a isekai-medieval themed.
(Medieval people are transported to work with King's needs)

Biomes:
- There's a chance that other biomes appear with different blocks.
- All biomes have specific depth ranges.

Pickaxes:
- You can use Stone and Bronze to create Pickaxes.
- Pickaxes boost speed (from Bronze) and increase efficiency.
- Higher-tier Pickaxes require higher-tier materials.

------------------------------------ *** LAYER 1 - COLLAPSE *** ------------------------------------
(formerly Boosters)
Collapse resets your progress, and will extend Quarry by 1 row.
Collapse Milestones:
- 1 Collapse: Unlock Auto-Assignation.
- 2 Collapses: Extend Quarry by 1 column, up to 20 total columns.
- ??? Collapses: Unlock new Upgrades.
- ??? Collapses: Unlock Artifacts.

- ??? Collapses: Miners are more efficient.
- ??? Collapses: Increase the luck on Ores.
- ??? Collapses: Gain more Green Papers.

Artifacts:
- Equip a specific kind of Miners with Artifacts which upgrade them with better abilities!
-- Burning: Passively damages blocks.
-- Critical: Damages blocks more rarely.
-- Fortune: Gives you more blocks on mining.
-- Possession: Damages multiple blocks at once.
-- Strength: Damages harder blocks more.
-- Weaken: Reduces the health of a block.
-- Midas: Increases the gains for Stone, Bronze, Gold, and Platinum.
- Or craft artifacts with Platinum to unlock new Miners.

Dimensions:
- Require a specific depth to spawn new blocks.
- Dimensions have barriers, which require teamwork for your Miners.
- The first dimension is called Consumption with Dark Blocks.
-- Dark Blocks can be sold for Dark Energy.
-- Dark Energy works the same as TLI^1.
-- Consumption stops at the strongest material: AV-308. (Not even Collapse extends the limit)
- Other dimensions nerf efficiency for block gaining and miner's efficiency.

------------------------------------ *** LAYER 2 - DARKEN *** ------------------------------------
With AV-308, you can darken the Sun. This resets your progress for Purple / Dark Tokens.
You will also unlock new features: Dark Biomes, Dark Recall, Dark Alloying, and Challenges.

Do not implement these L2 features below until L3.

- (Aarex) Elemental Essences
  (In order to transition to L3)
  (merged with Dark Orbs)
  * A post-Elemental feature in Dark World!
  * Elemental Essences multiply Element gains.
  * In order, later Essences are 2x weaker than earlier Essences.
  * Elemental Essences don't lose on Elemental unless respecced.

  * Elemental Essences require Essence and other Elemental resources.
  * You must select what requirements are increased.
  * Dark Orbs scale extremely slowly.
  * You can't create if you don't have at least 70% weight for an element.

------------------------------------ dark branch stuff ------------------------------------
(Dark Branch goes here)
- (incremental_gamer) Dark Balance
  * You can adjust a slider which gives various nerfs and buffs
  * There are upgrades that can nerf the nerfs (and make new ones, blah blah blah)
  * It also generates "Balance Energy" based on the slider and also differs in concentration (equal to the "composition" of the left and right side of the slider, similar to a concentration of a liquid)
  * Unlocks a section where you can merge these concentrations to create new ones and then you can merge them together to get dark orbs and special orbs as well
  -- (Aarex / Lightning)
   - Let's see... Dark Balance gives nerfs and buffs, which is like Alternate Timelines.
   - And you can use the sliders to spam concentration and normalcy.

   - Maybe could there be multiple sliders?
   - And has multiple resources at different levels?
   - Also, Darken is permanently finalized. Sorry.

------------------------------------ light branch stuff ------------------------------------
(Light Branch goes here)
- (Aarex) Lighten Mode
 * How?
    Point generation will be nerfed.
    Enhancements scale faster.
    Boosters scale instantly.
 * Replaces:
    Buildings, Boosters, Enhancements, and Elemental won't be replaced.
    Consumption is replaced with a different mechanic.
    Darken is transformed into Lighten with different gameplay.
      No Darken boosts are shared with the Light except with Space.
 * Toggling:
    All Lighten features only unlock as you progress in Lighten Mode.  
    Turning off Lighten Mode removes Lighten features, and readds Darken features.

Virtualization:
- With Boosters, you can virtualize for an extra Booster, Neutral Booster, and Anti-Booster.
- You can spend Anti-Boosters and other kind of Boosters for Theorems.
- These theorems can be putted into different "milestones," and you can respec them. 

Lighten (Layer 2b):
- Lighten doesn't reset Neutral Boosters and Anti-Boosters.
- You will unlock Interelemental Upgrades which keeps upgrades in Darken mode.
 - Some upgrades are based on Neutral Boosters.

Transfusion:
- You'll be given a transfuser.
- Transfusers convert one resource into another.
- Merging Transfusers allow you to convert multiple into another.
- Having enough progress allows you to multiply Elemental Essences.
- You can even reverse it!

There won't be new Lighten Challenges and new Elemental Essences.
Lighten is permanently finalized as Darken content is completed.

------------------------------------ *** LAYER 3 - ELEMENTAL *** ------------------------------------
Going Elemental resets Darken entirely.
Yes, including Darken Unlocks, Dark Upgrades, and Dark Resources.

Elements are gained by going Elemental, multiplied by Elemental Essence.
(based on the logarithmic rate)
	* There are a total of 12 elements, each coming with a feature.
  * For each set of 8 elements, there is a upgrade tree.
  * The prestige resource for elemental will be called...
    - Fire: Runes.
    - Water: Potions.
    - Air: Possession.
    - Earth: The Planet
  * Part 2:
    - Light: Lighten Mode.
    - Dark: Dark Orbs.
  * Part 3:
    - Space: Soup.
    - Time: Lattices.

------------------------------------ The Upgrade Tree ------------------------------------
- (downvoid) Upgrade Tree (L3)
  * A tree consists of 8 of 2x2 upgrade cubes branching off from (0,0,0) center.
  * Each element contains its own upgrade cube.
  * Elemental upgrades will cost their respective type of elemental essence.

  * Distance 1 boosts pre-Elemental and distance 2 unlocks a feature.
    -- For example, upgrade (2,0,0) unlocks Runes and upgrade (0,0,2) unlocks Lighten Mode.
    -- The position of each upgrade determines what it does. so like upgrade (1,1,0) is combining air with fire and will probably be a synergy between air's feature and fire's feature.
    -- Each upgrade (x,y,z) requires upgrades (x-1,y,z), (x,y-1,z), and (x,y,z-1) to buy. (unless one or more are 0, also replace -1 with +1 if it's negative)
  * There won't be upgrades beyond 2.
    -- If an upgrade has more than one non-zero coordinate, it will cost both or all 3 of those essence types.
  * However, coordinates with 2 increase the progress for improving features.
    
-- Branch Planning:
  -- First Set:
    - 1: air
    - 2: earth
    - 3: water
    - 4: fire
    - 5: light
    - 6: dark
    - 7: space
    - 8: time

------------------------------------ Upgrade Planning ------------------------------------
There are a total of 65 unique upgrades.
* any upgrade with 2 or more 0s in its coordinates will have a unique effect.
* any upgrade where all 3 numbers have the same absolute value will have a unique effect.

* Upgrade Tree 1:
(0,0,0): Unlock the Collider. (this costs 0 of each essence because all the coordinates are 0)
(1,0,0): Dark Energy gain is quadrupled.
(2,0,0): Unlock Runes.
(-1,0,0): Boosters are 5% more effective. (the base is raised to the 1.05)
(-2,0,0): Unlock Potions.
(0,1,0): Decrease all building scaling bases by 0.1
(0,2,0): Unlock Possession.
(0,-1,0): Double all non-alloy dark resource gain.
(0,-2,0): Unlock The Planet.
(0,0,1): Challenge requirements are divided by 100.
(0,0,2): Unlock Lighten Mode.
(0,0,-1): The 5th Dark Toning is ^2 as effective.
(0,0,-2): Unlock Dark Orbs.

------------------------------------ Collider ------------------------------------
Side-feature for (0,0,0).
- (randomtuba) Collider (L3)
  * (downvoid) Collider is unlocked when you buy the (0,0,0) upgrade.
  * You generate matter from points and antimatter from dark energy.
  * You can collide both to create annihilation energy and darker matter.
  * Annihilation Energy can be used to make the Collider more effective, and speed up production of other currencies outside of Collider
  * Darker Matter can be used to purchase upgrades.

------------------------------------ Element Features ------------------------------------
We'll go over the features of every element before Extend.

- (downvoid) Fire: Rune Sequences
  * Unlocks Runes and Rune Sequences, which do stuff depending on the sequence.
  * You have a limited supply of rune slots, and you can only use rune types from the branches where you have unlocked that branch's feature.
  * Before you can use Runes you have to make them, which costs rune slots and the element's essence. Each rune costs 1 rune slot.
  * There will be a large list of sequences that work and what their effects will be. However, some will have negative effects.
  * Time and Space rune sequences are more powerful than sequences without them, but they have a higher chance of having a negative effect.
  * The longer the sequence, the higher the chance of it having no effect.
  * Rune sequences can be deactivated and they will be lost on deactivation.

- Water: (open to suggestions)
  * aughhhhhh we could make use of the fact that water literally cleans stuff -Meta
  * that would remind me of the :aughhhhhh: thing - incremental_gamer

- (incremental_gamer) Air: 
  * Infuse air into other elements to boost their production/other things
  * Air can be mixed with other elements to produce reactions
  * Reactions can be used to create "potions" which have special effects
  * (open to suggestions)

- (downvoid) Earth: 
  * Unlocks new features
  * Can synergize with other resoures
  * The Planet: You must control a colony on a new planet and help them colonize the planet.
  * You will start out with some resources and you must keep the people alive to get resources from them.
  * The resources you collect can be used to upgrade the colony or boost other things.
  * You can also buy more rune slots with resources. They can also do some other stuff but we'll figure that out when we get there

- (Aarex) Light: Lighten Mode
  * [See Lighten in L2]

- (downvoid) Dark: Dark Balance
  * This will definitely be another mechanic in Darken.
  * [See Dark Balance in L2]

- (Aarex) Space: Space Banking
  * Allows you to permanently bank a small portion of Dark / Light Resources, but decay over time.
  * Spending Soup will enable a Dark Upgrade in Lighten Mode and Light Upgrade in Darken Mode!
  * These banks are considered "pseudo-Virtual," due to abilites to keep in challenges.
  * (downvoid) Drinking the soup will give you a currency called knowledge, which will be used to improve rune usage, potion crafting, possession power, and colony growth.
- (downvoid) Time:
  * The Lattice is a place where you can hop to "alternate timelines", where each timeline has a different effect. There are infinitely many timelines.
  * The lattice is 2-dimensional. Timelines are numbered "a+bi",
  * The further you go from the center, the more extreme the nerfs in those timelines are, making them less useful.
  * however, if you get lucky you could find a timeline without nerfs, but those get more and more rare the further out you go
  * the effects can be almost anything, here are a few examples:
    - t1: This is the normal universe, there are no differences.
    - t2: Point gain is ^1.5, but you can't gain dark tonings
    - t100: Booster base is 1.2 but dark matter gain *10
    - t63: Dark Fuel is 3x stronger.
    - t42069: Point gain ^0.14, Time Crystal effect ^6
    - t(-1): All runes' effects are inverted.
    - t(2+i): Point gain is ^1.25, but you gain half as many dark tonings
    - (yes, all the imaginary timelines are altering the effects of the timeline without the i)
  * Yes, procedurally generated challenges! These are going to be hellish to make...
  * Imaginary numbered timelines will be unlocked at the 3rd upgrade in the time branch.
  * (these could make for good challenges)
  * Changing timelines forces an Elemental reset.

  
------------------------------------ *** LAYER 2 - DARKEN (POST ELEMENTAL) *** ------------------------------------
Do not implement these L2 features below until L3.
